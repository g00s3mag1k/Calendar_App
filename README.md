## Description

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This workday calendar displays work hours from 9 AM to 5 PM and logs the current date and day in the header. Each box has an indicator that changes the color of the background depending on the current hour the user is in. For the past the color is grey, present is in red, and future is green. Each time block has an input field and save button where the user can write and store a schedule in their local storage for the day.
